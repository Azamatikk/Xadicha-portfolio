            <p>After joining the Coddy Camp Academy, I made different websites to test myself, 
              and one of them, the Bellissimo Pizza site, taught me a lot. Besides the Bellissimo 
              Pizza site, I also made Scooter, Burger, and other projects. I tried to make it to work 
              on myself. And it was a good lesson for me.</p>
